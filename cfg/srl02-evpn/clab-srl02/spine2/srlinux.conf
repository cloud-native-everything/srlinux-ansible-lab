# /etc/opt/srlinux/srlinux.rc
# System wide global cli environment configuration file:
# It is loaded first after launching the cli (before loading ~/.srlinuxrc)
#
# The used file format is TOML

[alias]
# Aliases can be entered at the start of the input line, and must represent a complete command.
#
# The alias name can contain the following:
#    - One or more fixed keywords, for example 'display stuff' and 'my-alias' are valid names.
#    - One or more required arguments, entered between '{' and '}'.
#    These arguments will then be substituted in the alias value before executing.
#
# For example, if you create this alias:
#   environment alias "display intf {name}" "info / interface {name} | as table"
#
# Then entering 'display interface ethernet-1/1' will execute 'info / interface ethernet-1/1 | as table'.
#
# The alias value can contain the following keywords:
#   - '{}' will add an optional unnamed parameter.
#       It defaults to '*' if it is not entered.
#   - '{<name>}' will add an optional named parameter with name '<name>'.
#       It defaults to '*' if it is not entered.
#
# For example, if you create this alias:
#   environment alias "display interface" "info / interface {} subinterface {subinterface} | as table"
#
# Then entering the following are all equivalent:
#   display interface
#   display interface *
#   display interface * subinterface *
# But you can of course also use other values
#   display interface my_interface subinterface 1
#
# E.g.:
# "display intf {name}" = "info / interface {name} | as table"
# "display interface" = "info / interface {} subinterface {subinterface} | as table"

[prompt]
# Change the prompt displayed before every input line.
#
